description: The Princess and Curdie is a children's classic fantasy novel by George
  MacDonald from late 1883. The book is the sequel to The Princess and the Goblin.
  The adventure continues with Princess Irene and Curdie a year or two older, and

  called Lina to help his quest.-- Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
